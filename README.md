# Words-transformation-with-Morse-Code
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:  "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on. Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.  For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-.-....-", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.  Morse code = [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
